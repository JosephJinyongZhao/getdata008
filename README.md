This repo contains The Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" project assignment files.

The Codebook.md explains the data sample experiment design, data collection, raw data variables, and my proceeded steps to get a tidy data set.

The run_analysis.R is the R script which imports the raw data, preceeds it, and export the tidy data as required called "tidy.txt".
